# leaflet-challenge
The USGS collects extensive data on earthquakes from around the world. This project challenges you to visualize this data, making it easier for the public and government organizations to understand and analyze the impacts of earthquakes. Your work will help the USGS better educate and inform about seismic activities and potentially secure more funding.

Instructions
Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Objective: Visualize an earthquake dataset using Leaflet.

Obtain the Dataset
- Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed (Link to external site).
- Choose a dataset, such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."
- Copy the URL of the JSON representation of this dataset.

Visualize the Data
- Use Leaflet to create a map.
- Plot all earthquakes on the map using their longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Customize data markers to reflect:
  - Magnitude: Larger markers for higher magnitudes.
  - Depth: Use color to indicate depth (darker colors for greater depths).
- Add popups to markers with additional information about each earthquake.
- Include a legend to provide context for your map data.
